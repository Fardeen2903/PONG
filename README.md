# PONG
Python code and implementation of a simple pong game.

### Pong - README

---

#### **Intro**
This project is a Python implementation of the classic **Pong** game. It features simple gameplay mechanics with enhancements, including:
- Dynamic ball speed that increases with paddle collisions.
- A visually appealing interface with responsive controls.
- A start screen with instructions.

Players can compete against each other using separate keyboard controls, and the game tracks scores for both players.

#### **Features**
1. **Start Screen**:
   - Displays "PONG" in a bold, retro-style font.
   - Press `Space` to start the game.
   
2. **Gameplay**:
   - Two paddles controlled by player inputs.
   - A ball that bounces off the paddles and walls.
   - Speed increases with each paddle hit, making the game more challenging.

3. **Score Tracking**:
   - Each playerâ€™s score is displayed at the top of the screen.
   - Scores reset after the ball leaves the play area.

4. **Visuals**:
   - Black background with white paddles and a red ball for a clean, classic aesthetic.

#### **Controls**
- **Left Paddle**:
  - Move Up: Press `W`
  - Move Down: Press `S`
- **Right Paddle**:
  - Move Up: Press `Up Arrow`
  - Move Down: Press `Down Arrow`

#### **How to Play**
1. Launch the game by running the Python script.
2. On the start screen, press `Space` to begin the game.
3. Use the controls to move the paddles and prevent the ball from going past your side.
4. The first player to miss the ball increases the opponent's score.
5. Enjoy the increasing challenge as the ball speeds up with every paddle hit!
